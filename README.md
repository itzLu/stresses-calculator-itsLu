# Stresses Calculator - Team 2

## Description
This MATLAB App Designer project implements a Stresses Calculator, primarily focusing on calculating various stress parameters such as principal stresses, maximum shear stress, and rotation stresses based on user input parameters. The app utilizes graphical representations, particularly Mohr's circle, to visualize stress states.

## Features
- Calculates principal stresses
- Computes maximum shear stress
- Determines rotation stresses
- Visualizes stress states using Mohr's circle

## Usage
1. Input parameters in the "Input Parameters" panel:
   - `Sigma_x`: Normal stress in the x-direction
   - `Sigma_y`: Normal stress in the y-direction
   - `Shear_xy (τxy)`: Shear stress
   - `Rotation Angle (θ)`: Angle of rotation
2. Click on the "Calculate Parameters & Draw Circle" button to perform calculations and visualize results.
3. View output parameters in the "Output Parameters" panel:
   - `Sigma_x1`: Normal stress in the x1-direction
   - `Sigma_y1`: Normal stress in the y1-direction
   - `Shear_x1y1`: Shear stress in the x1y1-direction
   - `Sigma1`: First principal stress
   - `Sigma2`: Second principal stress
   - `Theta_p1`: Angle of first principal stress
   - `Theta_p2`: Angle of second principal stress
   - `Maximum Shear`: Maximum shear stress
   - `Theta_s1`: Angle of maximum shear stress plane (first)
   - `Theta_s2`: Angle of maximum shear stress plane (second)

## Installation
Simply run the MATLAB App Designer project file `StressesCalculatorTeam2.mlapp` in MATLAB environment.
