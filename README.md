**Stresses Calculator - Team 2**
Welcome to the Stresses Calculator - Team 2 MATLAB App!

**Overview**
The Stresses Calculator - Team 2 MATLAB App is designed to help engineers and researchers in analyzing stress states and principal stresses using Mohr's Circle principles. This application allows users to input stress components (σx, σy, and τxy) and a rotation angle (θ), and it computes various stress parameters such as principal stresses (σ1, σ2), maximum shear stress (τ_max), and rotation stresses (σx1, σy1, τx1y1). Additionally, it visualizes the stress state using Mohr's Circle.

**Features**

**Input Parameters:** Users can input the values of σx, σy, τxy, and the rotation angle (θ) through dedicated input fields.
**Calculation:** Upon pressing the "Calculate Parameters & Draw Circle" button, the app performs calculations based on the input parameters and displays the results in the output panels.
**Output Parameters:** The computed values of principal stresses, maximum shear stress, and rotation stresses are displayed in the output panels.
**Visualization:** Mohr's Circle is plotted on the UIAxes to provide a visual representation of the stress state.

**How to Use**

**Input Parameters:** Enter the values of σx, σy, τxy, and the rotation angle (θ) in the respective input fields.
**Calculate Parameters: **Click on the "Calculate Parameters & Draw Circle" button to initiate the calculation process.
**View Results: **The computed parameters will be displayed in the output panels.
**Mohr's Circle: **The plotted Mohr's Circle on the UIAxes provides a visual representation of the stress state.

**Notes**

- Ensure that the input parameters are entered correctly to obtain accurate results.
The app follows the conventions of positive and negative stresses based on standard engineering principles.
